## Future Enhancements: Deeper AI Integration

This section outlines the planned integration of Gemini AI to further enhance the StudyFlow platform. These features are designed to streamline workflows, improve productivity, and provide intelligent assistance to users.

### 1. AI Task Generation
- **Description**: Upon creating a new project, users can provide a high-level description of their goals. The Gemini AI assistant will analyze this description and automatically generate a structured list of recommended tasks and sub-tasks.
- **User Flow**:
    1. User creates a project with a title and a detailed description.
    2. User clicks a "Generate Tasks with AI" button.
    3. The AI processes the description and returns a list of suggested tasks.
    4. User can review, edit, and approve the tasks to add them to the project.
- **Benefit**: Reduces the mental load of project planning and ensures comprehensive task coverage from the outset.

### 2. Smart Scheduling
- **Description**: The AI will recommend optimal due dates for projects and tasks based on several factors, including the team's current workload, historical performance on similar projects, and the estimated complexity of the tasks.
- **User Flow**:
    1. When creating a project or task, the due date field will feature an "AI Suggestion" option.
    2. The AI analyzes the team's schedule and project scope.
    3. It proposes a realistic deadline, which the user can accept or override.
- **Benefit**: Helps teams set achievable goals, prevents burnout, and improves time management.

### 3. Progress Summarization
- **Description**: A feature that allows users to generate on-demand summaries of project progress. The AI will synthesize recent activity, completed tasks, and current blockers into a concise report.
- **User Flow**:
    1. Inside a project or group, a user can request a "Progress Summary."
    2. The user can select a time frame (e.g., last 24 hours, last week).
    3. The AI generates a markdown-formatted summary that can be shared with team members or instructors.
- **Benefit**: Keeps all stakeholders informed, facilitates quick reviews, and helps identify issues before they escalate.

### 4. Learning Resource Recommendations
- **Description**: Based on the keywords and concepts found in project titles and descriptions, the AI will proactively recommend relevant learning materials.
- **User Flow**:
    1. As users work on a project, a "Recommended Resources" section will appear.
    2. The AI fetches and displays links to articles, tutorials, documentation, and academic papers related to the project's subject matter.
- **Benefit**: Supports the learning process by providing timely and context-aware information, helping users acquire the knowledge needed to complete their tasks.
